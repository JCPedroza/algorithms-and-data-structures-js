# Fibonacci Sequence

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
two terms. By starting with 0 and 1, the first 11 terms will be:

0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

Write a function that builds the Fibonacci sequence of the given length.

The Fibonacci sequence grows fast, you want a number type that can deal
with big numbers. In JS that's the job of `bigint`.

The function signature is

```typescript
fibonacciSequence(length: number): bigint[]
```
