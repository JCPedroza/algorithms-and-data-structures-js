# Algorithms

From Wikipedia:

> In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of
well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific
problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are used as specifications
for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, automated
decision-making and other tasks.

From Merriam-Webster:

> A procedure for solving a mathematical problem. A step-by-step
procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing some end.

## Exports

Since path names can get large when importing directly, use `exports.js` as a
proxy. Algorithms that you want to use elswhere should be imported to
`exports.js` first, and then exported through that module.

The algorithms made available in `exports.js` are assumed to be the most
efficient implementation of the algorithm collection.
