# Data Structures

From Wikipedia:

> In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and
storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely,
a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them,
and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an
algebraic structure about data.

From Merriam-Webster:

> Any of various methods or formats (such as an array, file, or record) for
organizing data in a computer.

## Exports

Since path names can get large when importing directly, use `exports.js` as a
proxy. Data structures that you want to use elswhere should be imported to
`exports.js` first, and then exported through that module.

The data structures made available in `exports.js` are assumed to be the most
efficient implementation of the data structure collection.
