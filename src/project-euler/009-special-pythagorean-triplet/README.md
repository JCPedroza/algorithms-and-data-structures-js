# Project Euler 009 - Special Pythagorean Triplets

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which

```text
a² + b² = c²
```

For example

```text
3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5²
```

Find the product abc such that

```text
a + b + c = n.
```

The function signature is

```typescript
function specialPythagoreanTriplet(targetSum: number): number
```
