# Project Euler 002 - Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
two terms. Starting with 0 and 1, the first 10 terms are:

```text
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
```

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
`limit`, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Function Signature

```typescript
function fiboEvenSum(limit: int): int
```

## Expected Behavior

```
In: -1
Out: 0

In: 0
Out: 0

In: 2
Out: 2

In: 10
Out: 10

In: 60
Out: 44
```

## Optimizations

Trial division isn't necessary. There are ways to only compute even fibonacci
numbers, including:

- Every third number in the sequence is even
- Calculating even values only with `next fibo = 4 * next fibo + current fibo`
