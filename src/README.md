# Algorithms & Data Structures

Welcome to algorithms and data structures implemented in JavaScript!

Each implementation module includes at least two things

1) Implementation binded to an identifier
  - For algorithms, identifier is `algorithm`
  - For data structures, identifier is `structure`
  - For project euler, identifier is `solution`

2) An id that identifies the implementation

This is the expected module interface for interoperability, including
unit testing.

## Algorithms

Implementations of different algorithms.

## Data Structures

## Project Euler
